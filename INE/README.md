eLearnSecurity Certifications

This section contains my certifications and hands-on training completed through **INE (formerly eLearnSecurity)**.

INE certifications emphasize practical, scenario-based learning focused on real-world offensive security skills. Alongside each certification, I include evidence of lab and CTF completion, as well as summaries of the skills developed during the training.
