## About the Certification Exam

INE Security’s **eJPT** validates that an individual has the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform the role of a **Junior Penetration Tester**.

The exam is fully practical and simulates real‑world scenarios where candidates must enumerate, analyze, exploit, and report on security weaknesses across multiple targets.

This certification serves as an entry point into Red Team certifications and prepares candidates for more advanced credentials such as the **eCPPT**.
