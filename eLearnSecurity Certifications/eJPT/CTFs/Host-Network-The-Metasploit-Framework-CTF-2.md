# Host & Network Penetration Testing: The Metasploit Framework CTF 2

**Platform:** INE / eLearnSecurity  
**Certification Path:** eJPT  
**Type:** Skill Check Lab (Graded)  
**Focus Area:** Metasploit Framework & Linux Exploitation  

---

## Overview
This Skill Check Lab focused on exploiting Linux-based systems using the Metasploit Framework. The lab required service enumeration, analysis of exposed services, exploitation of a vulnerable web application, and post-exploitation investigation to uncover hidden flags.

The objective was to demonstrate the ability to leverage Metasploit in real-world Linux environments, combining automated exploitation with manual exploration techniques.
