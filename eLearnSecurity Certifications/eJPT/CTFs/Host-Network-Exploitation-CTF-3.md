# Host & Network Penetration Testing: Exploitation CTF 3

**Platform:** INE / eLearnSecurity  
**Certification Path:** eJPT  
**Type:** Skill Check Lab (Graded)  
**Focus Area:** Multi-Target Exploitation & Privilege Escalation  

---

## Overview
This Skill Check Lab focused on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities across two target machines. The lab required service enumeration, exploitation of vulnerable and misconfigured services, interaction with local network services, and privilege escalation to retrieve flags from restricted directories.

The objective was to demonstrate end-to-end exploitation skills, from initial access to root-level compromise.
