# Web Application Penetration Testing CTF 1

**Platform:** INE / eLearnSecurity  
**Certification Path:** eJPT  
**Type:** Skill Check Lab (Graded)  
**Focus Area:** Web Application Vulnerabilities  

---

## Overview
This Skill Check Lab focused on identifying and exploiting common web application vulnerabilities. The objective was to enumerate the target web application, analyze its structure, exploit weak authentication mechanisms, and leverage injection techniques to retrieve hidden flags.

The lab simulated real-world web application attacks commonly encountered during penetration testing engagements.
