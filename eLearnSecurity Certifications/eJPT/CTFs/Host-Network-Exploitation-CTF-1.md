# Host & Network Penetration Testing: Exploitation CTF 1

**Platform:** INE / eLearnSecurity  
**Certification Path:** eJPT  
**Type:** Skill Check Lab (Graded)  
**Focus Area:** Linux Exploitation & Web Application Attacks  

---

## Overview
This Skill Check Lab focused on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities across two Linux-based targets. The lab required analyzing web applications, insecure services, weak credentials, and vulnerable plugins to compromise systems and retrieve hidden flags.

The objective was to demonstrate practical exploitation skills, combining enumeration, credential abuse, and exploitation of misconfigured services.
