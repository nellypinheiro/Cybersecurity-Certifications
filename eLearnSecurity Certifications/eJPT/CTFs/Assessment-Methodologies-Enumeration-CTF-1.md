## Overview
This Skill Check Lab focused on enumeration techniques used to identify and analyze services running on a target Linux system. The objective was to interact with exposed services, identify misconfigurations, and uncover security weaknesses that could be leveraged in later stages of a penetration test.

As a graded lab, it required independent analysis and problem-solving without access to guided solutions.
