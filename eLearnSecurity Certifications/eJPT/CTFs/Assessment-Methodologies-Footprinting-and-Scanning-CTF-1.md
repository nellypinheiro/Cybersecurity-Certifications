# Assessment Methodologies: Footprinting and Scanning CTF 1

**Platform:** INE / eLearnSecurity  
**Certification Path:** eJPT  
**Type:** Skill Check Lab (Graded)  
**Focus Area:** Footprinting & Scanning  

---

## Overview
This Skill Check Lab focused on reconnaissance, footprinting, and scanning techniques as part of the initial phase of a penetration testing engagement. The objective was to identify exposed services, misconfigurations, and publicly accessible information that could expand the target’s attack surface.

The lab required applying both active and passive reconnaissance techniques without guided solutions, reinforcing independent analysis and methodology.

- FTP
- MySQL client utilities

---

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Improved structured approach to footprinting and scanning
- Hands-on experience identifying exposed network services
- Better understanding of how small misconfigurations expand attack surfaces
- Reinforced importance of recon accuracy before exploitation
