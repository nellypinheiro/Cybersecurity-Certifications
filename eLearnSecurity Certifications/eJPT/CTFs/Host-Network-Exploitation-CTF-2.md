# Host & Network Penetration Testing: Exploitation CTF 2

**Platform:** INE / eLearnSecurity  
**Certification Path:** eJPT  
**Type:** Skill Check Lab (Graded)  
**Focus Area:** Windows Exploitation & SMB Attacks  

---

## Overview
This Skill Check Lab focused on exploiting a Windows-based target by identifying exposed services, abusing weak credentials, and leveraging SMB misconfigurations. The lab required analyzing NTLM hashes, performing credential-based attacks, and ultimately compromising the system to retrieve sensitive files.

The objective was to demonstrate practical Windows exploitation skills commonly encountered in real-world penetration testing engagements.
