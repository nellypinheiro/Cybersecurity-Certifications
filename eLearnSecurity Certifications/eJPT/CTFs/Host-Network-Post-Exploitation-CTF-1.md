# Host & Network Penetration Testing: Post-Exploitation CTF 1

**Platform:** INE / eLearnSecurity  
**Certification Path:** eJPT  
**Type:** Skill Check Lab (Graded)  
**Focus Area:** Post-Exploitation & Privilege Escalation  

---

## Overview
This Skill Check Lab focused on post-exploitation techniques applied after gaining initial access to target systems. The objective was to enumerate users, groups, scheduled tasks, credentials, and system configurations in order to uncover sensitive information and escalate privileges.

The lab emphasized understanding how attackers maximize access within compromised environments and how misconfigurations can lead to full system compromise.
