# Powershell for Pentesters CTF 1

**Platform:** INE  
**Certification Path:** eCPPT  
**Lab Type:** Capture the Flag (CTF)  
**Focus Area:** PowerShell, Lateral Movement & Multi-Stage Attacks  

---

## Overview
This Capture the Flag lab focused on leveraging PowerShell for initial access, credential extraction, lateral movement, and system compromise in a multi-stage attack scenario. The objective was to exploit misconfigurations, extract sensitive credentials, establish remote access, and pivot between internal systems not directly accessible from the attack machine.

The lab simulated a realistic enterprise environment where attackers must chain multiple techniques to fully compromise the target infrastructure.
