# Client-Side Attacks CTF 1

**Platform:** INE  
**Certification Path:** eCPPT  
**Lab Type:** Capture the Flag (CTF)  
**Focus Area:** Client-Side Attacks, Phishing & Lateral Movement  

---

## Overview
This Capture the Flag lab focused on performing client-side attacks to gain an initial foothold through phishing. The objective was to identify exposed information, craft a malicious payload, compromise a victim system, and pivot to exploit an internal server not directly accessible from the attack machine.

The lab simulated a realistic multi-stage attack scenario commonly observed in real-world engagements, combining social engineering, exploitation, lateral movement, and privilege escalation.
