# Web Application Penetration Testing CTF 2

**Platform:** INE  
**Certification Path:** eCPPT  
**Lab Type:** Capture the Flag (CTF)  
**Focus Area:** Advanced Web Application Penetration Testing  

---

## Overview
This Capture the Flag lab focused on identifying and exploiting advanced web application vulnerabilities to uncover hidden flags. The assessment required analyzing multiple application components and leveraging common attack techniques such as injection attacks, user enumeration, and exploitation of insecure functionality.

The lab simulated a real-world web application security assessment where misconfigurations, weak input validation, and insecure logic could be abused to bypass controls and expose sensitive data.
