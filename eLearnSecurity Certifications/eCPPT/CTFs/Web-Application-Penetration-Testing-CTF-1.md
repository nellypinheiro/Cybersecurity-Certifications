# Web Application Penetration Testing CTF 1

**Platform:** INE  
**Certification Path:** eCPPT  
**Lab Type:** Capture the Flag (CTF)  
**Focus Area:** Web Application Penetration Testing  

---

## Overview
This Capture the Flag lab focused on identifying and exploiting common web application vulnerabilities to uncover hidden flags. The objective was to analyze the target web application using reconnaissance, enumeration, and misconfiguration discovery techniques.

The lab simulated real-world web application security assessments, requiring the use of directory brute-forcing, information disclosure analysis, and file enumeration to identify security weaknesses and sensitive data exposure.
