# eCPPT – Skills & Knowledge Map

This document outlines the technical skills and competencies validated by the  
**INE Security Certified Professional Penetration Tester (eCPPT)** certification.

The eCPPT is a fully practical, hands-on certification designed for professional
Penetration Testers and Ethical Hackers, focusing on real-world exploitation,
post-exploitation, and Active Directory attacks.

## About the Certification Exam

INE Security’s **eCPPT** certification validates that an individual has the
knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform the role of a **modern
Penetration Tester**.

The exam emphasizes realistic attack scenarios covering:

- Initial Access
- Exploitation & Post-Exploitation
- Web Application Pentesting
- Active Directory Penetration Testing

This certification represents the next step after eJPT and prepares candidates
to continue toward advanced specializations such as the **eWPT**.

## Domain Breakdown & Skills

### 1. Information Gathering & Reconnaissance (10%)

- Perform host discovery on target networks
- Conduct port scanning and service enumeration
- Enumerate information from services running on open ports
- Identify potential attack surfaces based on exposed services

---

### 2. Initial Access (15%)

- Perform username enumeration to identify valid accounts
- Conduct password spraying attacks to obtain valid credentials
- Perform brute-force attacks against remote access services
- Gain initial foothold on Linux and Windows systems

---

### 3. Web Application Penetration Testing (15%)

- Perform web application enumeration
- Identify vulnerable endpoints and misconfigurations
- Exploit common web application vulnerabilities:
  - SQL Injection (SQLi)
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Command Injection
  - File Inclusion vulnerabilities
- Conduct brute-force attacks against web login forms
- Exploit vulnerable or outdated web application components
- Exfiltrate sensitive data and credentials from web applications and databases

---

### 4. Exploitation & Post-Exploitation (25%)

- Identify and exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in services
- Perform local and remote privilege escalation
- Dump and crack password hashes
- Identify locally stored unsecured credentials
- Maintain access and enumerate compromised systems
- Chain vulnerabilities to progress through the environment

---

### 5. Exploit Development (5%)

- Modify existing exploit code for reliability or customization
- Develop basic exploit code for:
  - Initial access
  - Post-exploitation
- Identify and exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities:
  - Stack overflows
  - Buffer overflows

---

### 6. Active Directory Penetration Testing (30%)

- Perform Active Directory enumeration
- Identify domain accounts with weak or empty passwords
- Perform AS-REP Roasting attacks against Kerberos
- Extract and abuse Kerberos tickets
- Perform lateral movement techniques:
  - Pass-the-Hash
  - Pass-the-Ticket
- Escalate privileges within the domain
- Obtain Domain Administrator access

---

## Technical Focus

The eCPPT focuses on **end-to-end penetration testing**, requiring candidates to:

- Operate without guided instructions
- Adapt tools and techniques to complex environments
- Combine multiple attack vectors
- Demonstrate deep understanding of Windows, Linux, and Active Directory attacks

---

## Progression Path

The eCPPT serves as a foundation for advanced certifications, including:

- **eWPT – Web Application Penetration Tester**
- Advanced Red Team and exploit development certifications
